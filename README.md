# RouterOS REST API "Schema Tools"

## Download

Pre-build schema files for RouterOS REST API are available on this project's website at
https://tikoci.github.io/restraml

> [!TIP]
> File an issue in this project, if you'd like a specific version built.

Included are three files:
 * `RAML` - schema in RAML 1.0 format, used in tools like Postman
 * `HTML` - documentation, generated from the schema
 * `JSON` - intermediate raw data from RouterOS's `/console/inspect` in JSON format, for use with data analytics.

### Postman Usage
For detailed instructions on using the RAML schema with Postman, see this forum article:
https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?p=1041886

> [!WARNING]
> Ironically, the RouterOS schema uncovered a bug in the most recent version of Postman that does not allow **directly** importing a RAML schema. Postman is working on a fix. Any existing loaded schema still works. Postman version 11.0.12 _and below_ work fine`. 
>
To import this schema into Postman App 11.1.14 _or greater_, the RAML schema must be **indirectly** as an "API", and then from API creating a collection from the API - rather than directly importing the RAML, see [raml1-to-postman issue #84](
https://github.com/postmanlabs/raml1-to-postman/issues/84#issuecomment-2125114449)
showing the process, including a video of the process.


## Build
## Generating the RAML file

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
2. Clone this repository
3. Install `js-yaml`: 
 `bun install js-yaml`
4. Run `rest2raml.js` like so:
 ```sh
 URLBASE=https://<IP or DNS name>/rest BASICAUTH=<user>:<pass> bun rest2raml.js
 # Example:
 URLBASE=https://192.168.88.1/rest BASICAUTH=admin:h3llow0rld bun rest2raml.js
 ```
 Wait a while for this code to run. It could take as long as an hour to process the entire schema.
5. Open a pull request to add the RAML file to this repository if it's missing ðŸ˜‰

## Generating the HTML page

1. Follow steps 1-2 above, or 1-4 if this repository doesn't currently contain a RAML file for your RouterOS version.
2. Install `raml2html` and `raml2html-slate-theme`: 
 `bun install raml2html raml2html-slate-theme`
3. Generate the HTML page with `raml2html`:
 ```sh
 raml2html --theme raml2html-slate-theme <RAML file> > <HTML file>
 # Example:
 raml2html --theme raml2html-slate-theme ros-rest-all.raml > ros-rest.all.html
 ```

## Implementation

### Schema Generation
The schema generation is done via JavaScript, specifically using `bun`, in `rest2raml.js`. The code connects to RouterOS via REST API, to use the `/console/inspect` command to traverse the "AST" for RouterOS config. The results of this intermediate phase are stored in an `inspect.json`, as retrieved from the router. With the inspect.json, `rest2raml.js` then builds that data into a RAML schema for API tools. 

> [!WARNING]
> **The generated schema is more for convenience than validation.** Generation is limited to the data available from `/console/inspect`, and what's reasonable to deduce. So there is not perfect fidelity between schema and API. For example, while there are _required_ and _optional_ parameters, all parameters are marked as optional in the schema. As a result, all attributes are generally shown - while using all of them is likely to be invalid. 

### GitHub 

#### Actions

GitHub Actions is used to build the schema published on this project's website:
 * [Builds](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml/actions/workflows/manual-using-secrets.yaml) for `manual-from-secrets.yaml` [Workflow](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml/blob/main/.github/workflows/manual-from-secrets.yaml) - uses GitHub Secret with information to connection to a RouterOS device on internet
 * [Builds] for (https://github.com/tikoci/restraml/actions/workflows/manual-using-docker-in-docker.yaml) `manual-from-docker-in-docker.yaml` [Workflow](https://github.com/tikoci/restraml/blob/main/.github/workflows/manual-from-docker-in-docker.yaml) - start a RouterOS CHR (via docker-compose and QEMU) **within the build**, and then `rest2raml.js` uses the "internal" CHR to generate the schema, without any external resources needed.


> [!NOTE] 
> Both actions use only `workflow_dispatch`, so new generation is **still manually triggered** by providing a version on the Action page in GitHub. Only the repo owner can do this.
